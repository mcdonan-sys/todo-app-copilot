## What did you ask Copilot to help you build?

I asked Copilot to help build a basic to-do list application. I broke the problem into small steps: HTML structure, styling, and JavaScript functionality.

## How did your approach to asking questions change?

At first, I asked very broad prompts. As I worked, I learned to give specific and focused instructions like "Add a delete button to each task."

## What parts of the development process with GitHub Copilot surprised you?

I was surprised at how accurately Copilot could infer my needs and complete entire functions. It often generated code I hadnâ€™t considered.

## What did you learn about the technology you used that you didn't know before?

I learned better JavaScript DOM manipulation techniques and how to create and append elements dynamically with event handlers.

## What would you do differently if you had to build this again?

I would modularize the code, perhaps separating functions and improving accessibility. I would also explore saving tasks in localStorage.

## Screenshot Evidence
